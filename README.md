# On The Road
## What is On The Road
On The Road is web application, that allows you to display your issues to your endusers in a simple way.

If you manage your issues in YouTrack or Jira, you usually have a versions assigned to your issues. This is the same with Jinya CMS. We wanted to give our customers, who are artists, and not developers, a beautiful and easy way to access the issues we have in our YouTrack system. In our opinion, YouTrack is awesome for developers, but it is hard for non devs. With On The Road, we want to create a simple web based interface for our customers to allow them to see what happens next in Jinya CMS.

On The Road automatically generates a Roadmap of the selected project based on the fix versions we set in YouTrack. Apart from that it allows the user to filter the issues by subsystem or in Jira it is called components.
